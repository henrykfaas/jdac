# BikePoints in London
This project takes data from the TFL BikePoints data base, maps them on the London boroughs and compares to index of deprivation. The aim is to explore where new BikePoints will have most impact on public health.

## Files
The latest code is in the Jupyter Notebooks which map the bikepoints on London boroughs (bikepoints.ipynb) and map the state of the composite index of deprivation on the London boroughs (map_london.ipynb). The R file (main.R) creates an interactive map of the bikepoints.
